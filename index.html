        I wanted to analyse plot summaries to learn more about the likely formulas in novels by the prolific British
        detective writer Agatha Christie. To narrow the project down, I focused on the 33 published, full-length novels
        where the
        detective was the famous Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot.</p>
    <p><b>A key aim for this project</b> was to use real-world visualisation techniques. I wanted to use the aesthetics
        of
        some kind of family game like Bingo or cards to give a sense that there were a fixed number of suspects or
        options,
        and suggest the idea of common characteristics among the novels.
    <p>
        <i> (It wasn't realistic in my timeframe to get into all of these hallmarks but just as a taster, there is
            usually a
            country home, an inheritance fight or extramarital affairs, some poison, false identities and many, many items
            left lying at the crime scene with the murderer's initials on them.)</i>

        I thought about using cards from the murder mystery board game Cluedo but then found a pack of Agatha Christie
        playing cards online, which I photographed and designed the page around.
        Another aim was to focus on the story of the project itself and weave the write-up of any technical skills, data
        decisions and visualisations into this page.

            Male and female murderers
        </b></p>
    <p> <b>Finding:</b></BR>I found that the murderer in Poirot novels was more often a man. 
    <p></p></pr>I think my data collection didn't give the
        richest picture of different killers' gender however because my 'M/F' choice for each murderer collapsed the
        main
        'female
        murderer' type and the 'female accomplice,' who is often on the side in these novels helping their
        accomplice-lover, and the gender difference may have felt starker if I had teased those out. </p>
<p>
        It also would have been interesting to analyse which methods were preferred by female and male killers (poison
        vs. bludgeoning for example) but I grouped together the methods of multiple killers within one novel, making
        that
        too broad in my database.<br><br>

        <b>Finding:</b>The victims were more often women, though the differences weren't as stark as I expected. I
        could have
        separated out the data more finely to emphasise when the woman was the intended target of the murder
        or when she
        was collateral damage.</p> <p><i>(Note: if you are in a Poirot novel and you know who the murderer is, keep
        quiet. There
        are a
        lot of deaths of observant also-rans who figure the killer out and have to be silenced.)</p></i>

    <p>
        The categorisations weren't always simple - e.g. a number of people die by suicide and so there were
        victims/deaths within the novel not always attached to a murderer, and sometimes the murderer killed
        themselves. In other instances, it wasn't made clear in the plot if someone had died accidentally or of
        natural causes or whether they were actually murdered. </p>
    <p>
        Some source sites also include old murders that had happened before the novel's timeframe began, or
        attempted
        murders and those methods, which I aimed to discount.
        There were also victims counted in some summaries because people have been wrongfully convicted for
        deaths and died
        through that process or were hanged for crimes. I decided to name any possible victims to keep that
        qualitative data recorded for readers to see
        and I ended up
        only using numerical counts of victims to find male and female ratios.

    <p>The idea for this analysis was answering the cliche of 'the husband did it' or 'the butler did it' with
        actual data
        analysis from the Poirot novels, so I wanted to include more qualitative information here about the
        position/relation of
        the murderer to the victim. After analysing the plot of the first few novels, I decided motives were too
        difficult to
        get into for this project so these descriptions also are the best hint at those.</p>

    <p> <b> Finding:</b> If we discount the 'avengers' (coming to them next) then the most likely killer was a 
        tie between a family
        member (a lot of inheritance motives) or a criminal element from outside, such as a con artist,
        thief or spy.
    </p>
    <p><i>(This surprised me as I think of Poirot murderers being more intimate connections than outside
            criminals.
            However, the current spouse was also a likely killer, and if I had grouped together 'current and
            former
            spouses/lovers' then that would have been a winning category. This made me realise that sometimes I
            can
            break out
            categories too finely when I know they will be major ones.)</i>

    <p>
        This data analysis and the visualisation through the chart did ended up skewed by the killers in
        <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> because there are 12 avengers of Daisy Armstrong's death and they
        all help to kill
        Cassetti. I thought about including them as one murderer because it was only one murder, but then this
        would have confused the
        logic by which I was including male and female murderers who had both killed a person. I also added
        Poirot into this category for his
        murder in <i>Curtain: Poirot's Last Case</i> but looking back there maybe should have been others acting
        in revenge who
        fit into this category.

    <p><b>Finding: The most common method of killing was poison.</b>This was a huge category that covered drug overdoses,
        poison in tea or
        candy, dentist chair murders and bedside glasses of water switched with acid. Cups were swapped around
        and swapped back.
        Traces were left and not left.</p>

    <p><b>The next most common method was stabbing, with a knife or dagger.</b> I decided to categorise through weapon
        rather than
        method so knife/dagger also encompassed a few slit throats. Being bludgeoned, or hit over the head, and
        also being shot
        by a gun were the next most common, with strangulation coming up fairly often too.</p>

        I used a dark red and blue colour scheme for the charts, mostly to work with the colours of the playing cards
        set
        though there are also blood connotations which worked for the murder mystery theme. I also tested out using
        screen
        descriptions of my charts for the first time. I used a formatting style I had liked before and experimented with
        a
        new font family. I tried to keep consistent hierarchies through various elements (e.g. yellow highlighted
        spoiler alert, red chart colour schemes, headers with a moustache motif to indicate new sections, bold text for
        data findings and italics for my asides.) </p>
    <p>
        I was pleased with incorporating the real-life visuals as well as web images like the moustache images to
        symbolise
        Poirot. I shot the playing cards close up against white backgrounds which I digitally removed, though I struggled breaking them out of
        uniform sizings that I'd set. I used the cards to emphasise the charts in more eye-catching ways and tie the piece together visually.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also tried to visually show more behind-the-scenes art to go with my emphasis on weaving the write-up and my thoughts into the project findings (e.g.
        photos of me adjusting the
        cards or my rough sketches of the board game inspirations I could use.)</p>

    <p>I tried to find an existing dataset I could analyse and got in touch with some Agatha Christie fans who had
        written
        on their websites about their findings from databases they had put together, but I didn't hear back. I decided
        to
        create my own database using online synopses from the site <a
            href="https://everythingagatha.com">everythingagatha.com</a>, Wikipedia entries for the
        novels
        and other plot summaries.</p>

    <p> I entered the data manually using the categories of book title, publication date, victim/s names, victim M/F,
        murderer/s names, murderer M/F, character description/position of the murderer (focusing on their relation to the victim), the method/weapon used and the broad primary setting for the novel.</p>

    <p>This shifted the focus of Project 3 onto data collection - which I haven't had as a main focus in a project before - and
        decisions around categorization, meaning the data analysis became a smaller manual part of the project. I tried
        to think
        backwards from the types of questions I wanted to answer and categorise as cleanly as I could around
        those. I realized I was changing my mind about certain categorisations as I went and wished I had kept more
        notes in
        that data collection stage, as I had learned to do during the analysis stage.</p>

    <p>I decided to make a searchable table to show the working data that I was making my charts from, so readers could
        also draw their own conclusions or challenge the ways I had categorised data-points. I also wanted to make this available because I had struggled by not being able to see the databases used by others writing or
        making
        charts about these books' plots.</p>
