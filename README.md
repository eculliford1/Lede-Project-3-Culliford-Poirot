# Lede-Project-3-Elizabeth-Culliford-Poirot
Project 3 for Lede Program 2023

**THE CASE OF THE MISSING PROJECT**

**Aims:**
-	To analyse the plots of Agatha Christie’s Poirot novels and determine likely formulas for these murder mysteries 
-	To incorporate real-life items into the design of the project page 
-	This wasn’t an initial aim but when I realised I would need to collect and organise the data myself, learning how to create a multi-faceted, usable dataset became a key Project 3 objective
-	Share more about the methodology and decision-making with the reader, in the read-me and also in the narrative of the project
  
**Data collection:**
-	I thought I would be able to analyse an existing dataset but couldn’t find one for the Poirot novels in a usable form and I didn’t hear back from enquiries I made to fans who discussed making their own databases online. I found some reporting by journalists making charts about Agatha Christie books but those pieces did not share their data.
-	I set my perimeters for the data collection by looking at the 33 full-length, published novels where Poirot is the main detective. I decided to collect my data using online plot summaries. One main source was www.everythingagatha.com and I corroborated that information and checked for plot summaries to explain other details on sites like Wikipedia.
-	I created a spreadsheet in Google Sheets and manually inputted data on the book title and publication date, the name and gender of the victim/s, name and gender of the murderer, a description of the murderer's position/relation to the victim, the weapon or method of the murder and the primary setting of the novel. I originally intended to look at the motives too but after a few books realised this was too complex for this task. 

**Data analysis:**
- I analysed the data in Google Sheets (basic analyses like counting variables) because the data collection was more time-consuming than I had planned
-	I had tried to work backwards from questions I thought I wanted to answer but realised while analysing the data that I should have kept better records about decisions I had made, to ensure consistency (e.g. whether suicides were categorised as victims within the novel, how accomplices to murder were categorised, whether long-dead victims should be counted as victims in a certain novel or only killings that took place within the book’s time frame)
