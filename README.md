# Lede-Project-3-Elizabeth-Culliford-Poirot
Project 3 for Lede Program 2023

**THE CASE OF THE MISSING PROJECT**

**Aims:**
-	To analyse the plots of Agatha Christie’s Poirot novels and determine likely formulas for these murder mysteries 
-	To incorporate real-life items into the design of the project page 
-	This wasn’t an initial aim but when I realised I would need to collect and organise the data myself, learning how to create a multi-faceted, usable dataset became a key Project 3 objective
-	Share more about the methodology and decision-making with the reader, in the read-me and also in the narrative of the project
  
**Data collection:**
-	I thought I would be able to analyse an existing dataset but couldn’t find one for the Poirot novels in a usable form and I didn’t hear back from enquiries I made to fans who discussed making their own databases online. I found some reporting by journalists making charts about Agatha Christie books but those pieces did not share their data.
-	I set my perimeters for the data collection by looking at the 33 full-length, published novels where Poirot is the main detective. I decided to collect my data using online plot summaries. One main source was www.everythingagatha.com and I corroborated that information and checked for plot summaries to explain other details on sites like Wikipedia.
-	I created a spreadsheet in Google Sheets and manually inputted data on the book title and publication date, the name and gender of the victim/s, name and gender of the murderer, a description of the murderer's position/relation to the victim, the weapon or method of the murder and the primary setting of the novel. I originally intended to look at the motives too but after a few books realised this was too complex for this task. 

**Data analysis and visualisation:**
- I analysed the data in Google Sheets (basic analyses like counting variables) because the data collection was more time-consuming than I had planned
-	I had tried to work backwards from questions I thought I wanted to answer but realised while analysing the data that I should have kept better records about decisions I had made, to ensure consistency (e.g. whether suicides were categorised as victims within the novel, how accomplices to murder were categorised, whether long-dead victims should be counted as victims in a certain novel or only killings that took place within the book’s time frame)
-	I made four charts in Datawrapper and created an interactive, searchable table for transparency. I annotated the table to highlight the books which are set in countries other than England, in order to draw readers into using the table for their own searches.  

**Design**
- I used a dark red and blue colour scheme for the charts, mostly to work with the colours of the playing cards set though there are also blood connotations which worked for the murder mystery theme. I also tested out using screen descriptions of my charts for the first time. I used a formatting style I had liked before and experimented with a new font family.
- I tried to keep consistent hierarchies through various elements (e.g. yellow highlighted spoiler alert, red chart colour schemes, headers with a moustache motif to indicate new sections, bold text for data findings and italics for my asides.
- I was pleased with incorporating the real-life visuals as well as web images like the moustache motif to symolise Poirot. I shot the playing cards close up and removed their backgrounds, though I struggled breaking them out of uniform sizings that I'd set. I used them to try and break out the charts in more eye-catching ways.
- I also tried to show more behind-the-scenes art to go with weaving the write-up into the project findings (e.g. photos of me adjusting the cards or my rough sketches of the board game inspirations I could use.)

**Challenges**
- I struggled to size the images outside of a couple of uniform sizes that my code had somehow set and am still figuring that out.
- I realised I should have kept records of decisions I was making in the early data collection because by the 30-something book, I was seeing faults in some logic and would have liked to go back and remember exactly where and why I had made a decision about categorisation. 
- I also learned not to draft a whole Read.me in github as I accidentally lost it. Here's to a second go.
  
**New skills**
- I used photographs of real-life objects and my own drawings, instead of stock web images to design my project page. I shot the playing cards on white backgrounds but ended up removing them on the computer.  
-	I made a searchable table from my dataset and made my methodology and concerns about my data more transparent and part of the narrative within the project.

**If I had more time...**
- I would have liked to break out
